**Overview:**

This repository contains code for analyzing gene expression data related to cardiomyopathy. It includes scripts to preprocess the data, perform exploratory analysis, and conduct differential gene expression analysis using R.

**Data:**

The gene expression data were generated using RNA sequencing techniques from samples collected from individuals with various forms of cardiomyopathy. The original data may be too large to upload directly to GitHub but can be accessed from the source repository or database (provide citation if available).

**Folder Structure:**

- **Data:** Contains the raw gene expression data files.
- **Scripts:** Contains R scripts for preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and differential expression analysis.
- **Results:** Contains outputs generated from the analysis, such as PCA plots, volcano plots, and differential expression tables.

**Installation:**

To run the code, you will need R installed on your system along with the following R packages:
- limma
- ggplot2
- dplyr
- readr
- tidyr

You can install these packages using the following R commands:

```R
install.packages("limma")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("readr")
install.packages("tidyr")
```

After installing the required packages, you can clone or download this repository and run the R scripts provided in the "Scripts" folder. Make sure to update file paths if necessary to point to the location of your data files.
